#' Budget season in Taganito Mine means sleepless nights for its personnel,
#'  especially the personnel from the Mine Engineering Department. Man hours
#'  budgeting is a very tiresome task. This job requires estimating work
#'  schedules, manpower requirements and lastly, manual encoding of
#'  man hours into the spreadsheet template.
#'
#'  The spreadsheet template is full of details and its size is stupendous. It
#'  has at least 12 sheets. Each sheet has more than a thousand rows and the
#'  number of columns are magnitudes more than the number of rows.
#'
#'  Encoding the man hours into the template requires great amount of patience
#'  and time. Also, finding encoding mistakes is also a discouraging task. This
#'  package is an attempt to automate the task of manually encoding the man
#'  hours data for manpower cost computation.
